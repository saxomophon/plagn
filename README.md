### Use this is in my project?

Sure thing. Please credit direct usage or derivations by providing a link to [this page](https://github.com/saxomophon/plagn). If you're just taking snippets, concepts or ideas a credit is not required.

### Even if it is commerical?

Yes. That is partly why LGPL was chosen. Note however, that you're the one responsible, if this goes wrong and your customer is unhappy. LGPL does not provide warranty, liability or any of these sorts.

:warning: LGPL was also chosen, because it provides the ability to use GPL libraries. These are usually not fine with commercial use. So be sure, to exclude libraries and Plags, that use GPL libraries.\
Current usage of GPL libraries: **0**.
