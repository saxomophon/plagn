# PlagMqtt

## Description

MQTT is a powerful protocol using a subscription model. It is often used in IoT applications, as it is well documented, light weight, and versatile.

The subscription model demands a broker to exist. The broker will receive "publications" of certain `topic` from clients and distribute those "publications" to the "subscribed" clients of that `topic`.

This Plag is meant to interact with MQTT protocol.
